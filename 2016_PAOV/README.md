#Abstract#
 In this paper, we propose an optimal choice scheme to determine the best option among comparable options whose current expectations are all the same under the condition that an investor has a confidence in the future value realization of underlying assets. For this purpose, we use a path-averaged option as our base instrument in which we calculate the time discounted value along the path and divide it by the number of time steps for a given expected path. First, we consider three European call options such as vanilla, cash-or-nothing, and asset-or-nothing as our comparable set of choice schemes. Next, we perform the experiments using historical data to prove the usefulness of our proposed scheme. The test suggests that the path-averaged option value is a good guideline to choose an optimal option.
